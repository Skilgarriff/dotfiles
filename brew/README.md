# Homebrew File

My homebrew files consist of the standard upgrade and install script as well as a Brewfile.

The brewfile is run anytime the global command of install or update is run. 

Ensure to keep the Brewfile updated and add any new dependencies.

TODO: A script that dumps the current brewfile and compares it to the one in this directory.
it then prompts the user to see if they would like to add the newly installed dependencies.
